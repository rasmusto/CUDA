This is the README file for the Summer 2011 CUDA group in Dr. Karavanic's CS410/510 GPGPU computing class at Portland State University

The final code is housed in the "jacobi_final" subdirectory.

There are 7 source files of interest:

1) seq_jacobi.c - sequential version for speed-up comparison
    
2) original_jacobi5.cu  - bug-fixed version of Dr. Wolfe's j5 kernel
3) original_jacobi6.cu  - bug-fixed version of Dr. Wolfe's j6 kernel

4) 1k_jacobi5.cu        - one kernel version of Dr. Wolfe's j5 kernel
5) 1k_jacobi6.cu        - one kernel version of Dr. Wolfe's j6 kernel

6) orig_J6M_v2.cu       - modified version of j6 kernel that allows specifying the block size
7) 1k_J6M_v2.cu         - one kernel version of j6 kernel that allows specifying the block size

These files can be built by running 'make' from the jacobi_final directory.

The output files will be called :

1) seq_jacobi.o 
  
2) original_jacobi5.o
3) original_jacobi6.o

4) 1k_jacobi5.o
5) 1k_jacobi6.o

6) orig_jacobi6Mod.o
7) 1k_jacobi6Mod.o

These programs can be run manually by executing the command:

./<filename>.o/ <m_size> <n_size>

Where m_size and n_size are the dimensions of the input matrix (square matrices where each side is a multiple of 16 + 2 work best).

The modified versions of the code (orig_jacobi6Mod, 1k_jacobi6Mod) take an additional parameter of the blocksize.
They can be run like this:

./<filename>.o/ <m_size> <n_size> <t_count>

Where t_count is the number of threads.

The m_size and n_size should be a multiple of t_count + 2 for best performance.





**************** GIT **************** (reference for us)
******** COMMANDS ********
git status
    shows modified/new/deleted files since last commit

git diff
    shows difference in files between working copy and HEAD revision (last commit)

git commit (-a) [FILES]
    save changes to specified files (or all files with -a (--all) flag)

git push
    push latest commits to the remote server (github)

git pull
    fetch and merge remote changes with local copy (merges only happen if local changes were committed)
